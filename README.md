# Unemployment Analysis with Python

## Overview
This project analyzes unemployment trends using Python. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis to derive insights into unemployment rates over time and across different regions.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of unemployment trends
- Statistical analysis (T-test)
- Linear regression modeling for forecasting

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- SciPy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/unemployment-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd unemployment-analysis
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset `unemployment_data.csv` into the project directory.
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python analysis.py
   ```
3. The script will:
   - Load and preprocess data
   - Perform exploratory data analysis
   - Conduct a t-test on the unemployment rate
   - Train a linear regression model
   - Output statistical insights and a forecast

## Data Source
The dataset should include:
- **Date**: Time period of the unemployment rate measurement
- **Unemployment Rate**: Percentage of unemployed individuals

Ensure the dataset is formatted correctly as a CSV file.

## Results
- Trends in unemployment rate over time
- Statistical insights from the t-test
- Forecasting results using linear regression
- Model evaluation with R-squared value
